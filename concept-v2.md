# Tech Nephew Brand Development Summary (V2)

## Core Concept
Tech Nephew provides patient, one-on-one tech support for Boomers through video calls. Think "helpful nephew energy" but as a professional service that actually solves problems and teaches solutions.

## Strategic Vision
- **Primary audience**: Boomers with capital, business knowledge, and potential business opportunities who struggle with everyday technology
- **Secondary audience**: Gen X/Millennial family members tired of being unpaid IT support
- **Short-term goal**: Build trust by solving real problems - help Boomers become confident with their devices
- **Long-term goal**: Become the trusted advisor to this demographic for business consulting and acquisition opportunities
- **Family positioning**: Maintain warm, nephew-like relationship under Quarterly Learnings umbrella

## Service Model - What We Actually Do
