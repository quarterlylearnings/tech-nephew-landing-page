                You know the drill. Your phone buzzes. You answer looking to catch up on life. They open with "the
                computer is broken again" and suddenly your Sunday
                afternoon is spent explaining why they need to actually click the blue button, not just look at it.
                We've all been there.

                    your weekends without worrying about "how to fix" who knows what.

                    frustrated when they ask the same question three times. Someone who isn't you.</p>

                        That's the goal! Once they have one good experience with patient, professional help, they'll
                        realize it's easier than bothering you. <strong>Plus, you can literally say "I got you a tech
                            person" and hand them the number.</strong>

                        Totally fine! You can hop on the call for moral support, or just be nearby. The point is
                        <strong>you're not the one doing the explaining</strong> - you're just there for comfort.

                        Think about it this way: what's your time worth? If you spend 2 hours every weekend on tech
                        support, this pays for itself pretty quickly. <strong>Plus, gift subscriptions are perfect for
                            holidays.</strong>

                        Fair question! I'll walk them through basic security practices and never ask for passwords or
                        sensitive info. <strong>This is about teaching them to fish, not doing their banking for
                            them.</strong>

                        If they can use a phone to call you when something breaks, they can use a phone to call me.
